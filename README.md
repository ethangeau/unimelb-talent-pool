## Introduction

Unimelb Talent Pool is a full-stack web application platform that was developed to showcase the talents and profiles of Melbourne University students to potential employers.

This platform was deployed using Docker containers and Azure Virtual Machine to achieve highly efficient and scalable deployment, resulting in faster deployment times, reduced downtime, and improved performance for end-users.

The technologies used in this project include React, Redux, Express, MongoDB Atlas, Node, Docker, and Azure Virtual Machine, which provide a robust and scalable solution for the platform.

## Setup

- create the `.env file` for both client and server
- run `npm i` and `npm start` for both client and server if running locally
- run `docker-compose up -d` if running in docker containers
